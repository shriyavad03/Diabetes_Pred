# Diabetes_Pred
Predicting Diabetes using Regression Analysis
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:
NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
statsmodels
scikit-learn
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

Code
Template code is provided in the boston_housing.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the included visuals.py Python file and the housing.csv dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in visuals.py is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.

Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory boston_housing/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb
or

jupyter notebook Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb
or open with Juoyter Lab

jupyter lab
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

Data
This data set has been obtained  from Kaggle and cleaned. It takes 9 features and has 100,000 data entries. The model has a prediction accuracy of 95.79%, and uses Logistic Regression.
